## **Who we are**
RAINDROPS is a student-driven collaboration between University College London (UCL), the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU, Norway)m and Brigham Young University (BYU, USA). RAINDROPS seeks to investigate the potential of utilizing a team of uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) that features the low costs and scalability necessary to facilitate incipient-stage wildfire detection and suppression over large areas with rapid response times.


## **Our mission**
The envisioned solution combines two classes of systems, namely those tasked with observation and fire detection (“Observation UAS”) and those tasked with fire suppression (“Fire-suppression UAS”). The first set of robots emphasizes long-endurance and exploits a multi-modal sensing payload, sensor fusion algorithms, and deep learning to detect and localize incip-ient-stage wildfires rapidly. The platforms will implement meteorologically-informed path planning and multi-agent teaming such that the fire search and detection process is autonomous. The UAS tasked with fire suppression integrate a specialized payload that is released and dropped on an identified fire location to suppress it. With the location of an incipient-stage wildfire detected by the Observation UAS and communicated to the team, Fire-suppression UAS are tasked to rapidly fly towards the area of interest to deliver their suppression payloads. The complete system-of-systems emphasizes autonomous operation and scalability of costs to facilitate adoption.

## **Fire-Observation Aerial Robots**
The Fire-observation aerial robots of RAINDROPS integrate a multi-modal sensing payload tasked with the goal of detecting and localizing incipient-stage wildfires from high-altitude. The system relies on deep learning applied across sensor signatures and a custom actuated perception solution to increase area coverage. The fire-observation aerial robots of RAINDROPS shall operate in a team of systems with multiple such units operating simultaneously in order to cover a 1,000km2 area rapidly.

## **Fire-suppression Aerial Robots**
The Fire-suppression aerial robots of RAINDROPS ferry a glider vehicle that is released [(1) “Drop-off”], ignites its solid-state engine [(2) “Ignition”, optional step that may not be integrated on the final prototype] and autonomously homes to the exact location of the fire [(3) “Homing & maneuvering”]. At this point, it releases the suppression material—in a specialized droppable container—such that it penetrates through dense forest canopy and gets released at the exact fire location. The fire-suppressing glider aircraft also operates autonomously while retaining connectivity with the ferrying robot to get up-to-date information about the fire [(4) “Fire-suppression payload delivery”]. The glider autonomously flies away from the fire [(5) “Fly-away”] in order not to contribute flammable materials to the fire. Its small battery, responsible only for avionics and low-power servo mechanisms (no motors) shall be enclosed on a specialized fire-safe container.
